# Hey, I'm Aaron 👋
## Background
I'm a cs major @ umich dearborn 〽️ who aspires to help other people in need. Typically, I build applied AI tools with React, Python, LLM APIs, and Agent Frameworks

### My work:
- Implemented a job board component using JavaScript, React, and Tailwind for Michigan Devfest 2025's website
- Building Discord bots for a tech server to scrape and post news using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Render
- Leading workshops and leetcode sessions as tech lead in Google Developer Groups on Campus at UM-Dearborn

Currently, I'm further exploring AI's capabilities by building more with it. Also, I'm looking forward for internship opportunites where I can help build practical AI software tools to make a positive difference in people's lives.

## Side Quests
- play piano 🎹
- binge on netflix and youtube 📺
- listen to rnb, synthwave, classical, lofi, and rave 🎧
- watch NBA 🏀
- learn about the F1 hype and culture 🏎️

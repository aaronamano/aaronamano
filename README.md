# Hey, I'm Aaron 👋
## Background
I'm a cs major @ umich dearborn 〽️ who aspires to help other people that are in need. Typically, I build applied AI tools with React, Python, Typescript, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, LLM APIs, and AI Agent Frameworks

### My work:
- Helped build a website for Michigan Devfest by implenting a job board component using JavaScript, React, and Tailwind
- Creating Discord bots for a tech server to scrape and post news using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Render
- Taking on a techincal leadership role at my Google Developer Groups where I'll conduct workshops and leetcode sessions

Ultimately, I'm looking forward to build more with AI and further explore its capabilities. I'm also searching for internship opportunites where I can help build practical AI software tools to make a positive difference in people's lives.

## Side Quests
### What I do on my freetime:
- play piano 🎹
- binge on netflix and youtube 📺
- listen to rnb, synthwave, classical, lofi, and rave 🎧
- watch NBA 🏀
- learn about the F1 hype and culture 🏎️

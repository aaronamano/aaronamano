# Hey, I'm Aaron 👋
## Background
I'm a cs major @ umich dearborn 〽️ who aspires to help other people in need. Typically, I build tools with React, Python, LLM APIs, and Agent Frameworks

- Leading workshops and leetcode sessions as tech lead in Google Developer Groups on Campus at UM-Dearborn
- Implemented a job board component using JavaScript, React, and Tailwind for Michigan Devfest 2025's website

**I'm exploring more of AI's capabilities by consistently building with it. Also, I'm looking for internship opportunites where I can contribute to practical AI software that make a positive difference in people's lives.**

## Side Quests

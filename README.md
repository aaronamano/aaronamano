# Hey, I'm Aaron 👋
## Background
cs @ umich dearborn 〽️

I typically builds personal AI tools with React, Python, LLM APIs and Agentic Frameworks. I've done freelance work where I helped develop a website for Michigan Devfest 2025 and build bots for a Discord server. Currently, I'm taking on a technical leadership position on campus.

I'm looking for internship postions where I can help build practical software tools with agentic/generative AI.

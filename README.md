## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Aaron! I am an aspiring computer science major who enjoys learning new skills and loves to take on difficult tasks!
Currently, I am an undergraduate student in the class of 2028, who is just starting to get his feet wet and learn everything about computer science along the way.
My interestes in computer science are mainly software engineering, fullstack web development, and artificial intelligence!

My computer science journey: <br>
<ul>
  
<li>
<b>senior year high school</b>: I had decent exposure to computer science by taking IB Computer Science HL and joined Girls Who Code.
I learned the fundamentals and how to program a little with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 
</li>

<li>
<b>freshman year college</b>: I tested out of a computer science class for my first semester thanks to my IB CS HL exam score.
I learned some new stuff by myself outside of school. I learned the basics of C++ and TypeScript.
I also taught myself how to use React, Tailwind, and Bootstrap through project-based learning.
</li>
  
</ul>

# Hey, I'm Aaron 👋

## Elevator Pitch
I'm a cs major @ umich dearborn 〽️ who loves to help other people that are in need.
Over the past several months, I've done freelance work where I helped build a website using React and JavaScript for Michigan Devfest 2025 and develop fullstack projects with mainly React (Next.js), Python (FastAPI), MongoDB, and Supabase while integrating LLM APIs and agentic frameworks.
Currently, I'm creating Discord bots for a server while taking on a techincal leadership role at my Google Developer Groups on Campus club. Ultimately, I'm looking forward to building more with AI and further exploring its capabilities as well as finding internship opportunites where I can help build practical, applied AI software to help people and make a positive difference in their lives.

## Side Quests
On my freetime, I:
- play piano 🎹
- binge on netflix and youtube 📺
- listen to rnb, synthwave, classical, lofi, and rave 🎧
- watch NBA 🏀
- learn about the F1 hype and culture 🏎️
